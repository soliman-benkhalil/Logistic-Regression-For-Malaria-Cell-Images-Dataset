# Logistic-Regression-For-Malaria-Cell-Images-Dataset
Model of logistic regression 

# Image Classification with HOG Features and SGDClassifier
In this project, I developed an image classification model using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier. 
The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of cell images. 
Additionally, I created a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for easy predictions.

# Key Features
Feature Extraction: Utilized HOG features for robust image representation.<br>
Classification: Applied SGDClassifier with logistic loss for classification.<br>
Preprocessing: Standardized features for improved performance.<br>
Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and loss curves.<br>
GUI: Developed a graphical user interface for easy image uploads and predictions.<br>
# Results
Accuracy: 86%<br>
AUC (Area Under the Curve): 0.93<br>
Visualizations<br>
ROC Curve: Shows the performance of the classifier across different thresholds.<br>
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of classification performance.<br>
Loss Curve: Illustrates the training and testing loss over iterations.<br>
# Code Details
The code processes images from a dataset, extracts HOG features, trains an SGDClassifier, and evaluates the model using various metrics. The implementation includes:<br>

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Resizing images, feature extraction, and standardization.<br>
Model Training: Using SGDClassifier with logistic loss and regularization.<br>
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, classification report, ROC curve, and confusion matrix.<br>
GUI: Allows users to upload an image and receive predictions with a graphical interface.<br>
